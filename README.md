**repositories.csv**: Information about the public repositories of each user.


1) Data scraping was performed using the GitHub API, focusing on users from Berlin and their repositories. The relevant user information was extracted into a structured format for analysis.
2) A surprising finding was that the most common surname among users was Schneider, with only three occurrences. This suggests a relatively low diversity in surnames among the sampled developers.
3) Developers should consider enhancing their profiles and engagement, as hireable users had a marginally lower chance of sharing email addresses. This might suggest potential improvements in networking and job opportunities.
